# THIS CODE DOES NOT COMPILE :)
This repository is simply for keeping track of what changes we make to our files in OnBot Java.
The package names within the code do not line up with the file structure in the repository,
and the FIRST Tech Challenge SDK is not included in the project.

The repo also contains a few package-info.java files that aren't on the control hub because OnbotJava literally won't let us have a Java file named without camelcase.
